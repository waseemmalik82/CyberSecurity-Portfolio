## Purpose
Integrate networking, HTTP, and web concepts into a coherent incident investigation workflow.

## Key Concepts Learned
- End-to-end incident walkthrough: from detection to triage
- Correlating network captures, HTTP logs, and host events
- How to document an investigation (evidence, timeline, remediation)

## SOC / Analyst Relevance
- Demonstrates ability to connect logs and network evidence in a real scenario
- Shows readiness for L1 triage (collect, enrich, escalate)

## Commands / Tools Used
- Wireshark packet captures
- Browser devtools HTTP inspection
- Simple timeline creation (notes / markdown)

## Evidence / Proof

## Lessons & Next Steps
- Build a short incident report from this lab and upload as `incident-report-week2.md`
- Start practicing SIEM searches using similar data
